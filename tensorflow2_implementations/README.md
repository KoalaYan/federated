# Federated Learning implementations
The code and data examples are used for testing different FL designs in TensorFlow 2.4

Include example on MNIST dataset (folder MNIST dataset), a custom radar dataset (folder FL radar dataset, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03367) and a federated implementation of a reinforcement learning algorithm (deep Q-Learning)

Please check the readme files for further information.
